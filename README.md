# Watch Frame

An iOS application written in Objective-C that lets you combine your Apple Watch screenshots with an actual device case. Pick a case, select an image and export it to the camera roll quickly. 

Unfortunatelly, it was rejected by Apple because the high fidelity device mockups could create a misleading association with Apple products. Well, its a shame, because I really wanted prettier Watch screenshots. Anyway, it's open source now, so, feel free to use and abuse it.

On the more technical side, if you are learning iOS, this app has some stuff you might want to take a look at:

- Coordinators (flow-controllers) with Objetive-C;
- Make app store screenshots look good with [SimulatorStatusMagic](https://github.com/shinydevelopment/SimulatorStatusMagic);
- Screenshots automation with [Fastlane Snapshot](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/snapshot/);
- An in-app purchases manager;
- Basic stuff to theme the app (dark mode was the goal, but now, nahhh);

And that's it folks!
